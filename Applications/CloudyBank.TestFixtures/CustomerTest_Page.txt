|Comment|
|This is a fitnesse page, which test if the business partner was added or not with right values|
|In the page the Path to the CloudyBank.TestFixtures.dll has to be set to correct place|
|Also the Slim FitSharp runners is used and it's location has to be specified|
|The configuration file App.Config also has to be loaded - in order to specify how to create Spring context etc|
|All dll and other support files, which are loaded by the CloudyBank.TestFixtures.dll have to be placed inside the SLIM folder|
